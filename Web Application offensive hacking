# Ethical Hacking


Steps to perform Ethical Hacking 

1) Reconnaissance - Pre attack phase ( to gather information as much as can possible before launching attack)
2) Scanning - after observed target and after just preceading the attack. Here identify spceific vunerability.
3) Gaining Access 
4) Maintaining Access 
5) Clearing Tracks


# Terminology 

1) Threat
2) Vulnerability - Loophole or weakness
3) Exploit - Take advantage of vulnerability
4) Payload - set of operations
5) Attack - Break into system
6) Attack Vectors - Path to access information system
7) Zero - day Attack

# Popular Web servers - Apache , Xampp , Nginx, IIs web server etc.,
# OWASP online Community

  AIM - to raise awareness related to web application security

- Produces freely - available articles, methodlogies,documentation, tools,
                    and technologies in the field of web application security.

BUG BOUNTY HUNTING -- GET STARTED


# Programming Languages - Java,Node.js,PHP,ASP,dot Net,MySQL.
# Learn web application measures and Hacking techniques.
# Keep update yourself about latest trends and current vulnerabilites.


Methodology for bug bounty hunting

- Check the target scope and building sitemaps
- Recon to find target
- Google dorks for gathering info about target
- Reveiw all service, ports and applications on the target
- Check backened language and hunt subdomains
- Check each request and response
- Fuzz for errors and explore vulnerability
- Attack vulnerabilites

Tools: Web vulnerability scanners

- w3af- detect and identify web application firewall
- owasp zap - web application scan for vulnerability
- Burpsuite - web parameter tampering
- Nikto - black box web server vulnerability scanner.
- Netsparker - Find security flaws in automated manner
- SQLmate,sqlmap - identifies sqli vulnerabilities
- Arachni -evaluate web applications security
- Wapiti - built-in fuzzer, black box web app vul scan
